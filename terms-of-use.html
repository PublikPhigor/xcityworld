        <p class="policy-text">By placing an order with XcityWorld for website design and development services, you confirm that you are in agreement with and bound by the terms and conditions below.</p>
        <h4><b>Definitions</b></h4>
        <p class="policy-text">
            <b>The Client:</b> The company or individual requesting the services of XcityWorld Limited.
        </p>
        <p class="policy-text">
            <b>XcityWorld:</b> TPrimary designer/site owner & employees or affiliates.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Terms and Conditions</b></h4>
        <p class="policy-text">
            These are the standard terms and conditions for Website Design and Development and apply to all contracts and all work undertaken by XcityWorld for its clients:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>OUR FEES AND DEPOSITS</b>
                <p>
                    A 70% deposit of the total fee payable under our proposal is due immediately upon you instructing us to proceed with the website design and development work. The remaining 30% shall become due when the work is completed to your reasonable satisfaction but subject to the terms of the "approval of work" and "rejected work" clauses. We reserve the right not to commence any work until due first installment has been paid in full.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>SUPPLY OF MATERIALS</b>
                <p>
                    You must supply everything we need to complete the project and in the format we need to complete the work in accordance with any agreed specification. Such materials may include, but are not limited to images, content, logos and other printed material. Where there is any delay in supplying these materials to us which leads to a delay in the completion of work, we have the right to extend any previously agreed deadlines by a reasonable amount. Where you fail to supply materials, and that prevents the progress of the work, we have the right to invoice you for any part or parts of the work already completed. You'll review our work; provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates we set together.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>VARIATIONS</b>
                <p>
                    We are pleased to offer you the opportunity to make reversions to the design. However, we have the right to limit the number of design proposals to a reasonable amount and may charge for additional designs if you make a change to the original design specification after approval has been given.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website development phase is flexible and allows certain variations to the original specification. However any major deviation from the specification will be charged at the cost of N30,000. A minor change is anything that has to do with adjusting of size, change of placement, moving of component, colour change, image replacement or text change. A major change is an addition of a new feature which has been agreed possible by XcityWorld e.g. new shipping option, new payment option. This does not mean upgrades of unlimited complexity, but within the measurable framework of the existing content management system.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>PROJECT DELAYS AND CLIENT LIABILITY</b>
                <p>
                    Any time frames or estimates that we give are contingent upon your full co-operation and complete and final content in photography for the work pages. During development there is a certain amount of feedback required in order to progress to subsequent phases. It is required that a single point of contact be appointed from your side and be made available on a daily basis in order to expedite the feedback process.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>APPROVAL OF WORK</b>
                <p>On completion of the work you will be notified and have the opportunity to review it. You must notify us in via mail of any unsatisfactory points within 7 days of such notification. Any of the work which has not been reported in writing to us as unsatisfactory within the 7-day review period will be deemed to have been approved. Once approved, or deemed approved, work cannot subsequently be rejected and the contract will be deemed to have been completed and the 40% balance of the project price will become due.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>REJECTED WORK</b>
                <p>If you reject any of our work within the 7-day review period, or not approve subsequent work performed by us to remedy any points recorded as being unsatisfactory, and we, acting reasonably, consider that you have been illogical/irrational in any rejection of the work, we can elect to treat this contract as at an end and take measures to recover payment for the completed work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>PAYMENT</b>
                <p>Upon completion of the 7-day review period after the website design and development has been completed, we will invoice you for the 30% balance of the project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>WARRANTY BY YOU AS TO OWNERSHIP OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</b>
                <p>You must obtain all necessary permissions and authorities in respect of the use of all copy, graphic images, registered company logos, names and trademarks, or any other material that you supply to us to include in your website or web applications.

            <li>

For example, if the remaining balance on a completed project is N1,000, and that balance has not been paid within ten business days, the new balance on the complete project will automatically be increased to N2,000.

                <p>
                    If the client fails to handle the requests within 3-5 business days, the project timeline will be moved in simultaneously. However, if the client fails to handle the requests within ten business days, the project will be frozen and the sum of N50, 000 will be made payable to XcityWorld to resume the project.
                </p>
            </li>

                <b>WEBSITE MAINTENANCE</b>
                <p>This agreement allows for minor web site maintenance to pages over a 3-months period, up to an average of one half hour per regular web site, including updating lines and making minor changes to a sentence or paragraph. It does not include updating or replacing nearly all the text from a page with new text, major page reconstruction, new pages, guest books, discussion webs, and navigation structure changes, attempted updates by client repairs or web design projects delivered to the client via diskette. The period of 3 months begins on the date the client's web design site has been published to client's hosting service or 90 days from the date this agreement was signed, whichever comes first. If the client's web design package includes database access using Server Side Script, then very minor page code changes will be accepted under this maintenance plan. Major page code and/or database structural changes will be charged accordingly.</p>
